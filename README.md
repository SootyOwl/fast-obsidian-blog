# Site template

A simple & fast HTML site built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) featuring:

- Markdown content with frontmatter
- Wiki-style internal linking between pages using `[[links]]`
- Docker containerization
- Custom Nunjucks layouts

This repository contains the actual .md content of my site. I will try to keep it up to date with the source however I use Obsidian Sync to get my notes into the site itself, so this is essentially an outdated mirror at best.
